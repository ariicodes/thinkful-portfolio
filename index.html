							<h3>About Me</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							My passion for web development sprouted in 2018 but when I think
							back, I think it really started during the MySpace days 😂. I love
							the fact that I'm able to create my own websites with words and a
							combination of letters & rules. I can't wait to be able to do that
							with a team because building things alone can be a daunting and
							lonely task.
						</p>
						<p>
							As I've stated above, I'm an artist. I create via different
							mediums which includes painting, graphic design, & photography.
							Along with creating, I have a love for herbalism and the healing
							properties that come along with it. Someday I plan to combine all
							of my interests and talents into the perfect app.
